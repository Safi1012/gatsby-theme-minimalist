## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

In order to provide a big selection of icons, this theme makes use of the fabulous _React Icons_ library. The _React Icons_ library comes with 9 different icon sets (_FontAwesome_, _Ionic_, _Material Design_, _Typicons_, _Github Octicons_, _Feather_, _Game_, _Weather_, and _Dev_). Just browse through the vast list of icons [https://react-icons.netlify.com](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/icons/fa) and copy the icon name (e.g. `FaTwitter`) and paste it to your options in the `socialList[{icon: 'FaTwitter'}]` option section.
